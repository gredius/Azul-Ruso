Thank you for visiting my GitHub.

As a major not related to IT, I've never been in this field but I've had a lot of interest in it.
In this ever-changing global society, the technology of IT has become more important than anything else. Under these circumstances,
it was time for young friends in each country to learn coding, so I also decided to learn IT and coding to keep up with this trend.

Although I don't have great skills in IT now, I want to become an IT developer
who grows more and more based on passion for learning new knowledge.
